# Wake Up Alarm

This is my overenginneered solution to getting out of bed in the morning.

## Problem

My alarm always wakes me up but more often than not instead of getting out of bed like a normal human I will lay in my bed on my phone or just go back to sleep.

## Hypothesis

Once I get downstairs into the kitchen the easiest thing to do will be to make breakfast and get on my with my day.

## Solution

Instead of putting the off button on your phone or regular alarm clock in your room where you will roll over and go back to bed why don't you put the off button in the kitchen where you can make breakfast.

this system involves 3 main parts

1.  The server, which all communication goes through and serves as the source of truth for the ringing state
2.  The pause button, this temporary disables the alarm so you have time to get to the off button
3.  The off button, turns off the alarm but is placed somewhere far away, in my case the kitchen
